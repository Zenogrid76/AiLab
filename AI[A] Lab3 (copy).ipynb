We can see the memory location in Python3 with the `id()` and `hex()` methods.\n\n> `id()` -> prints the memroy adress of an object.  \n> `hex()` -> converts the memory adress to hexadecimal representation.\n\n```py\n>> print(hex(id(arr)))\n0x7f3bec064ec0\n```\nSo, whenever we're typing `arr`, we're not actually referencing the array itself. We're referencing a variable that has the reference of the memory location where the array is stored. \n\n### Copying an array\n\nThere are 3 ways we can copy arrays in Python:\n* Simply using the assignment operator\n* Shallow copy\n* Deep copy\n\n#### Using Assignment Operator\nWe can use `=` to copy arrays.\n\nFor example\n```py\nnew_arr = old_arr\n```\n***Something to remember :***\n> In python, Assignment statements don't copy objects, they create bindings between a target and an object. When we use `=` operator user may think that this creates a new object which it doesn't. It only creates a new variable that shares the reference of the origianl object.\n\n**Simply put, `new_arr = old_arr` just copy the adress of the `old_arr` to `new_arr`. So, no new array has been created in the memory. These `old_arr` and `new_arr` now points to the same adress in the memory.**\n\nFor example,\n```py\narr1 = [2, 6, 9, 4]\n\n# Prints the address of the arr1 in the memory\nprint(hex(id(arr1)))\n\n# assigning arr1 to arr2\narr2 = arr1\n\n# Prints the address of the arr1 in the memory\nprint(hex(id(arr2)))\n\n# making a change in arr1\narr1[1] = 7\n\n# displaying the arrays\n>> print(arr1)\n>> print(arr2)\n0x7f5dcf5d0e80\n0x7f5dcf5d0e80\n[2, 7, 9, 4]\n[2, 7, 9, 4]\n```\nSo you see, because the two array shares the same memory address, chaning the value in one array changes the other too.\n\n> Sometimes we want to have the original values unchanged and only modify the new values or vice varsa. In Python we can use the other two copy methods which are,\n\n* Shallow Copy \n* Deep Copy\n\n**To make these copy work, we use the `copy` module.**\n\n#### Shallow Copy\n> A shallow copy creates a new object which stores the refernce of the original elements. So, a shallow copy doesn't just copies the reference of nested objects. This means a copy process doesn't recurse or create copies of nested object itself.\n\n**In other words, a shallow copy can copy a normal list / array and store that in a different memory space. However, if the list is a nested list, the shallow copy method will only copy the whole list in a another memory location, however, it will not copy nested list objects. Instead it'll create the reference of origianl memory for the nested items.**\n\nFor better understanding this, let's see an example,\n```py\nimport copy\n\nold_list = [1,2,3,4]\nnew_list = copy.copy(old_list)\n\nnew_list.append(5)\n\nprint(f\"Old list: {old_list}\")\nprint(f\"Old list memory location: {hex(id(old_list))}\")\nprint(f\"New list: {new_list}\")\nprint(f\"New list memory location: {hex(id(new_list))}\")\n```\nAfter running the program, we'll get,\n\n```txt\nOld list: [1, 2, 3, 4]\nOld list memory location: 0x7f42452b8e00\nNew list: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\nNew list memory location: 0x7f42452b8480\n```\nSo, with this method we can `copy` a list in python. However, this only **really** works with normal lists. We'll get into problems if we use this method to copy nested lists. \n\nFor example,\n\n```py\nimport copy\n\nold_list = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]\nnew_list = copy.copy(old_list)\n\nnew_list[0] = ['a','b','c']\n\nprint(f\"Old list: {old_list}\")\nprint(f\"Old list memory location: {hex(id(old_list))}\")\nprint(f\"New list: {new_list}\")\nprint(f\"New list memory location: {hex(id(new_list))}\")\n```\nOutput:\n```txt\nOld list: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\nOld list memory location: 0x7f7df913c800\nNew list: [['a', 'b', 'c'], [4, 5, 6]]\nNew list memory location: 0x7f7df913c580\n```\nThis works fine. Now, let's see what happens if we change the nested list objects inside the original list.\n\n```py\nimport copy\n\nold_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\nnew_list = copy.copy(old_list)\n\nnew_list[0][0] = \"a\"\n\nprint(f\"Old list: {old_list}\")\nprint(f\"Old list memory location: {hex(id(old_list))}\")\nprint(f\"New list: {new_list}\")\nprint(f\"New list memory location: {hex(id(new_list))}\")\n```\nOutput:\n\n```txt\nOld list: [['a', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\nOld list memory location: 0x7ff49810f900\nNew list: [['a', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\nNew list memory location: 0x7ff49810f680\n```\n`old_list` and `new_list` both changes. This happen because, the `shallow copy` method only copy the whole list in a new memory but it doesn't touch the nested list objects. Instead it creates a reference of the original memory location for them. That is why when we change only the whole list the changes happen in only the new list not both. However, when we touch the nested list objects, changes happen in both the new and the old lists. So, this is `Shallow Copy`.\n\n> In case anyone wandering about `list.copy()` method, Yes, that is a shallow copy method too.\n\n*If you're still confused read this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17246693/what-is-the-difference-between-shallow-copy-deepcopy-and-normal-assignment-oper) from stackoverflow.*\n\n#### Deep Copy\n\n> A deep copy creates a new object and recursively adds the copies of nested objects present in the original elements.\n\nA deepcopy solves the problem we had with the nested list with the shallow copy. Let's now apply deep copy method with the nested list example we just used earlier.\n\n```py\nimport copy\n\nold_list = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\nnew_list = copy.deepcopy(old_list)\n\nnew_list[0][0] = \"a\"\n\nprint(f\"Old list: {old_list}\")\nprint(f\"Old list memory location: {hex(id(old_list))}\")\nprint(f\"New list: {new_list}\")\nprint(f\"New list memory location: {hex(id(new_list))}\")\n```\nOutput:\n\n```txt\nOld list: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\nOld list memory location: 0x7fea699b4880\nNew list: [['a', 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]\nNew list memory location: 0x7fea699b4600\n```\n\nSo, using the `deepcopy()` we've solved the problem here.\n\n\n***Something to remember :***\n> Although in python we can change the array / list size anytime, however, in other programming languages such as C++ or Java, the size is fixed from the get go. So, in this course for learning purposes we'll always fix the size of the arrays / list from the get go too. It'll help us understand thigs more easily. For example,\n\n```py\n>> arr = [0] * 10\n>> print(arr)\n[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n```\nThis will create an array of length 10. The value `0` indicate that the value of that index is empty.\n\n### Array Traversal\nArray traversal is accessing the elements of an array one by one. (Basicly, `for loop`)\n\nIn python3,\n```py\n>> arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5]\n>> for i in arr:\n>>     print(i, end=\" \")\n0 1 2 3 4 5\n```\n### Reverse printing an Array\nWe have an array and we need to print it's values in reverse order.\n\n```py\n# with for loop\ndef print_array_reverse(arr):\n   for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):\n       print(arr[i], end=\" \")\n\n# with while loop\ndef print_array_reverse(arr):\n   i = len(arr) - 1\n   while i >= 0:\n       print(arr[i], end=\" \")\n       i -= 1\n\n>> print_array_reverse([0,1,2,3,4,5])\n5 4 3 2 1 0\n```\n### Resizing an Array\n\n### Shifting an array Left\n### Shifting an array Right\n### Inserting an element into an Array\nWe have an array for example, `arr = [1 ,20 ,5 ,78 ,30 ,0]` (Here, `0` means empty value). We need to insert a value for example, `100` in the `2`<sup>nd</sup> index. So that the resulting array will looks like,\n`arr = [1 ,20 ,200, 5, 78, 30]`\n\nSo, we can achieve this by,\n* Shift all the values 1 index to right (we have some empty space to the right)\n* After shifting all the values to the right, index `2` will be empty. Simply, insert the value into index `2`\n\n![Gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/aJg1xxk4TR3Csvp9St/giphy.gif)\n\nIn python3,\n\n```py\ndef insert(arr, index, value, size):\n    if size == len(arr):\n        print(\"No space in array!\")\n        return\n\n    if index < 0 or index > size:\n        print(\"Wrong Index!\")\n        return\n\n    else:\n        for i in range(size, index - 1, -1):\n            arr[i] = arr[i - 1]\n\n        arr[index] = value\n        print(arr)\n\n>> arr = [1, 20, 5, 78, 30, 0]\n>> insert(arr, 2, 100, 5))\n[1, 20, 100, 5, 78, 30]\n```\n### Removing an element from an array\n### Rotating an array Left\n### Rotating an array Right\n\n\n### Rotate By K cell to right\n\n```py\n\n```",
